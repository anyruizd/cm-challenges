# What I learned

This challenge consisted in creating a line chart that shows a weekly report with two lines, each one formed by several points. When moving the mouse over each point a small popup label containing text with a numerical value is displayed.

Once the card was layed out, I researched about how to make charts in pure HTML and CSS. I found [here](https://css-tricks.com/how-to-make-charts-with-svg/#article-header-id-5) that the best way to make them is by using SVG and also I found there a very useful guide of how to make my own line chart.
